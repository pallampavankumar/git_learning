# Git File States (File Lifecycle)

## Overview
Git tracks files through different states before and after they are committed.

---

## The Three Main States

### 1. Working Directory
The working directory is where you create, edit, and delete files.

Files here are not yet prepared for commit.

---

### 2. Staging Area
The staging area is where you place files that are ready to be included in the next commit.

This allows you to control exactly what goes into a commit.

---

### 3. Repository
The repository stores committed snapshots of files permanently.

Once files reach this stage, they are part of Git history.
