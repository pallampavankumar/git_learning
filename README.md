- Common mistakes

This makes concepts easy to remember and apply.

## 🧠 Book Analogy (Core Idea)

- Project → Book  
- File → Page  
- Commit → Published edition  
- Branch → Alternate storyline  
- Merge → Combine storylines  
- Conflict → Two authors edited same paragraph  
- Remote (GitHub) → Online library

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. Start from `01_basics`
2. Read one topic at a time
3. Try commands locally
4. Observe output
5. Move to next topic

---

## 🏁 Who Is This For?
- Beginners learning Git from scratch
- Developers wanting strong fundamentals
- Interview preparation
- Daily Git reference

---

## ⭐ Final Note
Git is not about memorizing commands.
It’s about understanding **how changes move** from:
> working directory → staging → commits → branches → remote

Once that clicks, Git becomes easy.

Happy Learning 🚀
